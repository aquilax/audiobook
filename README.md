# audiobook
Simple Audiobook manager

## Idea
1. Store each audiobook in separate direcoty
2. Have book meta-data stored in `audiobook.yaml` file in the root directory of the audiobook
3. Provide a command line tool to scan recursively directory and find all the meta-files inside
4. Provide `init` command which will create the meta-data template file and optionaly search third party for the meta-data
